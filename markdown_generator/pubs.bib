	abstract = {The recently discovered bactericidal properties of nanostructures on wings of insects such as cicadas and dragonflies have inspired the development of similar nanostructured surfaces for antibacterial applications. Since most antibacterial applications require nanostructures covering a considerable amount of area, a practical fabrication method needs to be cost-effective and scalable. However, most reported nanofabrication methods require either expensive equipment or a high temperature process, limiting cost efficiency and scalability. Here, we report a simple, fast, low-cost, and scalable antibacterial surface nanofabrication methodology. Our method is based on metal-assisted chemical etching that only requires etching a single crystal silicon substrate in a mixture of silver nitrate and hydrofluoric acid for several minutes. We experimentally studied the effects of etching time on the morphology of the silicon nanospikes and the bactericidal properties of the resulting surface. We discovered that 6 minutes of etching results in a surface containing silicon nanospikes with optimal geometry. The bactericidal properties of the silicon nanospikes were supported by bacterial plating results, fluorescence images, and scanning electron microscopy images.},

	abstract = { The advent of microfluidics in the 1990s promised a revolution in multiple industries from healthcare to chemical processing. Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is a continuous-flow microfluidic particle separation method discovered in 2004 that has been applied successfully and widely to the separation of blood cells, yeast, spores, bacteria, viruses, DNA, droplets, and more. Deterministic lateral displacement is conceptually simple and can deliver consistent performance over a wide range of flow rates and particle concentrations. Despite wide use and in-depth study, DLD has not yet been fully elucidated or optimized, with different approaches to the same problem yielding varying results. We endeavor here to provide up-to-date expert opinion on the state-of-art and current fundamental, practical, and commercial challenges with DLD as well as describe experimental and modeling opportunities. Because these challenges and opportunities arise from constraints on hydrodynamics, fabrication, and operation at the micro- and nanoscale, we expect this Perspective to serve as a guide for the broader micro- and nanofluidic community to identify and to address open questions in the field. },

	abstract = {[Objective] Surveillance tools for early cancer detection are suboptimal, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and biomarkers are urgently needed. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained increasing scientific interest due to their involvement in tumor initiation and metastasis; however, most extracellular RNA (exRNA) blood-based biomarker studies are limited to annotated genomic regions. [Design] EVs were isolated with differential ultracentrifugation and integrated nanoscale deterministic lateral displacement arrays (nanoDLD) and quality assessed by electron microscopy, immunoblotting, nanoparticle tracking and deconvolution analysis. Genome-wide sequencing of the largely unexplored small exRNA landscape, including unannotated transcripts, identified and reproducibly quantified small RNA clusters (smRCs). Their key genomic features were delineated across biospecimens and EV isolation techniques in prostate cancer and HCC. Three independent exRNA cancer datasets with a total of 479 samples from 375 patients, including longitudinal samples, were used for this study.Results ExRNA smRCs were dominated by uncharacterised, unannotated small RNA with a consensus sequence of 20 nt. An unannotated 3-smRC signature was significantly overexpressed in plasma exRNA of patients with HCC (p<0.01, n=157). An independent validation in a phase 2 biomarker case's control study revealed 86% sensitivity and 91% specificity for the detection of early HCC from controls at risk (n=209) (area under the receiver operating curve (AUC): 0.87). The 3-smRC signature was independent of alpha-fetoprotein (p<0.0001) and a composite model yielded an increased AUC of 0.93. [Conclusion] These findings directly lead to the prospect of a minimally invasive, blood-only, operator-independent clinical tool for HCC surveillance, thus highlighting the potential of unannotated smRCs for biomarker research in cancer. Data are available in a public, open access repository. RNA-sequencing data have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) under accession numbers E-MTAB-8528 and E-MTAB-8529.

	abstract = {Solid-state nanopores have been shown to be suitable for single molecule detection. While numerous modeling investigations exist for DNA within nanopores, there are few simulations of protein translocations. In this paper, we use atomistic molecular dynamics to investigate the translocation of proteins through a silicon nitride nanopore. The nanopore dimensions and profile are representative of experimental systems. We are able to calculate the change in blockade current and friction coefficient for different positions of the protein within the pore. The change in ionic current is found to be negligible until the protein is fully within the pore and the current is lowest when the protein is in the pore center. Using a simple theory that gives good quantitative agreement with the simulation results we are able to show that the variation in current with position is a function of the pore shape. In simulations that guide the protein through the nanopore we identify the effect that confinement has on the friction coefficient of the protein. This integrated view of translocation at the nanoscale provides useful insights that can be used to guide the design of future devices.},

@article{Arun:2023aa,
	abstract = {Identifying and characterizing the effect of combination therapies is of paramount importance in various diseases, including cancer. Various competing null models have been proposed to serve as baselines against which to compare the effect of drug combinations. In this work, we introduce Correlated Drug Action (CDA), a baseline model for the study of drug combinations in both cell cultures and in patient populations. CDA assumes that the efficacy of pairs of drugs to be used in a combination may be correlated, that is, if the efficacy of a drug in a given patient or cell is high (low), then the efficacy of the other drug may also be high (low) in the same patient or cell. Our model can be used in the temporal domain (temporal CDA or tCDA) to explain survival curves in patient populations, and in the dose domain (dose CDA or dCDA), to explain dose-response curves in cell cultures. At the level of clinical trials, we demonstrate tCDA's utility in identifying possibly synergistic combinations and cases where the combination can be explained in terms of the monotherapies. At the level of cells in culture, dCDA generalizes null models such as Bliss independence, the Highest Single Agent model, the dose equivalence principle, and is consistent with what should be expected in sham combinations. We demonstrate the applicability of dCDA in assessing combinations in experimental MCF7 cell-line data by introducing a new metric, the Excess over CDA (EOCDA)},

2) The model can be applied in both temporal and dose domains to analyze different types of data, such as survival curves or dose-response curves.
3) The authors demonstrate the utility of tCDA at the clinical trial level and dCDA's applicability in experimental data assessment using a new metric, EOCDA.},

	abstract = {Nail psoriasis significantly impacts the quality of life in patients with psoriasis, which affects approximately 2--3% of the population worldwide. Disease severity measures are essential in guiding treatment and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. However, due to subsidy, convenience and low costs of health care in Taiwan, doctor usually needs to manage nearly hundreds of patients in single outpatient clinic, leading to difficulty in performing complex assessment tools. For instance, Nail Psoriasis Severity index (NAPSI) is used by dermatologists to measure the severity of nail psoriasis in clinical trials, but its calculation is quite time-consuming, which hampers its application in daily clinical practice. Therefore, we developed a simple, fast and automatic system for the assessment of nail psoriasis severity by constructing a standard photography capturing system combined with utilizing one of the deep learning architectures, mask R-CNN. This system not only assist doctors in capturing signs of disease and normal skin, but also able to extract features without pre-processing of image data. Expectantly, the system could help dermatologists make accurate diagnosis, assessment as well as provide precise treatment decision more efficiently.},

@article{Kim:2020vk,
	abstract = {Defects in crystalline materials are of broad and fundamental interest. In condensed-matter physics, defect dynamics contain essential information about the microscopic processes of crystal formation and melting. Two-dimensional melting (2D) is widely accepted to be mediated by the proliferation of edge dislocations. In 2D crystals, vacancies and interstitials are, in fact, bound pairs of edge dislocations and disclinations. They are expected to play critical roles in 2D melting. We demonstrated significant progress in quantifying the dynamical processes of interstitials. We also propose a simple yet powerful method in visualizing the time-averaged configurations of the defects, providing a direct tool to assess whether the detailed balance is obeyed or violated in the fluctuating processes in a lattice. In two-dimensional (2D) solids, point defects, i.e., vacancies and interstitials, are bound states of topological defects of edge dislocations and disclinations. They are expected to play an important role in the thermodynamics of the system. Yet very little is known about the detailed dynamical processes of these defects. Two-dimensional colloidal crystals of submicrometer microspheres provide a convenient model solid system in which the microscopic dynamics of these defects can be studied in real time using video microscopy. Here we report a study of the dynamical processes of interstitials in a 2D colloidal crystal. The diffusion constants of both mono- and diinterstitials are measured and found to be significantly larger than those of vacancies. Diinterstitials are clearly slower than monointerstitials. We found that, by plotting the accumulative positions of five- and sevenfold disclinations relative to the center-of-mass position of the defect, a sixfold symmetric pattern emerges for monointerstitials. This is indicative of an equilibrium behavior that satisfies local detailed balance that the lattice remains elastic and can be thermally excited between lattice configurations reversibly. However, for diinterstitials the sixfold symmetry is not observed in the same time window, and the local lattice distortions are too severe to recover quickly. This observation suggests a possible route to creating local melting of a lattice (similarly one can create local melting by creating divacancies). This work opens up an avenue for microscopic studies of the dynamics of melting in colloidal model systems.},

	abstract = {Nanoscale deterministic lateral displacement (nanoDLD) has emerged as an effective method for separating nanoscopic colloids for applications in molecular biology, yet present limits in throughput, purification, on-chip filtration, and workflow restricting its adoption as a practical separation technology. To overcome these impediments, array scaling and parallelization for integrated nanoDLD (i-nanoDLD) enrichment devices are developed to achieve a density of ≈83 arrays mm−2 with 31 160 parallel arrays, producing an ≈30-fold concentration of the target colloid and a record throughput of 17 mL h−1. Purification using a dual-fluid input embodiment of i-nanoDLD is demonstrated to successfully remove background contaminants from target colloid samples, including urine. Used serially, high-throughput enrichment and purification chips achieve >1700 gain in particle over protein concentration compared to input sample. Additionally, integration of upstream filter banks shows improved operation lifetime > 7× for particles with diameters close to the gap size. Finally, the integrated design and associated flow rates allow a straightforward approach to chip-to-world interfacing as demonstrated using a prototype system for facile, turn-key sample processing. Collectively, these developments advance nanoDLD into the range of sample volumes and process times needed for research and clinical samples.},

@article{Kim:2021tj,
	abstract = {While it would be desirable that the output of binary classification algorithms be the probability that the classification is correct, most algorithms do not provide a method to calculate such a probability. We propose a probabilistic output for binary classifiers based on an unexpected mapping of the probability of correct classification to the probability of occupation of a fermion in a quantum system, known as the Fermi--Dirac distribution. This mapping allows us to compute the optimal threshold to separate predicted classes and to calculate statistical parameters necessary to estimate confidence intervals of performance metrics. Using this mapping we propose an ensemble learning algorithm. In short, the Fermi--Dirac distribution provides a calibrated probabilistic output for binary classification. Binary classification is one of the central problems in machine-learning research and, as such, investigations of its general statistical properties are of interest. We studied the ranking statistics of items in binary classification problems and observed that there is a formal and surprising relationship between the probability of a sample belonging to one of the two classes and the Fermi--Dirac distribution determining the probability that a fermion occupies a given single-particle quantum state in a physical system of noninteracting fermions. Using this equivalence, it is possible to compute a calibrated probabilistic output for binary classifiers. We show that the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) in a classification problem is related to the temperature of an equivalent physical system. In a similar manner, the optimal decision threshold between the two classes is associated with the chemical potential of an equivalent physical system. Using our framework, we also derive a closed-form expression to calculate the variance for the AUC of a classifier. Finally, we introduce FiDEL (Fermi--Dirac-based ensemble learning), an ensemble learning algorithm that uses the calibrated nature of the classifier's output probability to combine possibly very different classifiers.},

Good quantitative agreement between both calculations is seen, though we find that the simple theory is unable to correctly capture the change in the access resistance of the pore if a particle is placed at the pore entrance. Finally, we examine the spatial variations in the solutions of the PNP-NS equations, finding that the electro-osmotic flow through the pore is completely disrupted for sufficiently large particles.},

	abstract = {Deterministic lateral displacement (DLD) is a technique for size fractionation of particles in continuous flow that has shown great potential for biological and clinical applications. Several theoretical models have been proposed to explain the trajectories of different-sized particles in relation to the geometry of the pillar array, but experimental evidence has demonstrated that a rich class of intermediate migration behavior exists, which is not predicted by models. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework to infer the trajectory of particles in the whole array on the basis of trajectories in the unit cell. This framework explains many of the unexpected particle trajectories reported in literature and can be used to design arrays for the fractionation of particles, even at the smallest scales reaching the molecular realm. We also performed experiments that verified our predictions, even at the nanoscales. Using our model as a set of design rules, we developed a condenser structure that achieves full particle separation with a single fluidic input.
